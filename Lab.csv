Joost is a p2p on demand video player that offers professional (legal) programming much like on your television, but whenever you want.  The service is free, however, there are video advertisements interspersed between and during programs as well as small type or image ads on the sides of your screen.</p>

<p>With very heavy backing from media giants CBS and Viacom, Joost looks good to take on competitors <a href=""http://crunchbase.com/company/bablegum"" title=""Bablegum"">Bablegum</a> and <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/06/first-look-at-livestation-not-much-to-report/"" title=""Microsoft LiveStation"">Microsoft LiveStation</a>.  Currently Joost has content deals with CNN, the NHL and Sony as well as their financiers CBS and Viacom (MTV, Comedy Central etc). They have also <a href=""http://www.joost.com/forums/p/2007/08/widget-api/"" title=""recently"" rel=""nofollow"">recently</a> developed a new Widget API open to third parties to make their own Joost widgets. </p>

<p>Unlike many online video platforms, joost does require a download and cannot play video directly from users&#8217; browsers.  joost offers a desktop client that allows the user to watch on-demand TV over the internet. In addition, Joost enhances the TV experience by offering interactive tools. For example, users will be able to chat with friends while watching a show. The channels will also have interactive displays where users can discover behind-the-scene content.</p>

<p>Joost&#8217;s peer-to-peer technology also lowers the cost of channel owners by reducing the amount of data the servers must stream out. joost only serves some selected users, while the rest of the data is distributed from user to user.  </p>

<p>Rumor has it that Joost is in talks with hardware manufacturers to <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/06/15/embedded-joost-will-change-the-market/"" title=""embed"">embed</a> its platform into TV set-top boxes. If the move were successful it could change the TV industry substantially.</p>

<p>Joost is now fully public and open to all.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Joost has recently deactivated it&#8217;s software client and now streams it&#8217;s entire catalog via Adobe&#8217;s Flash Player which is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.</p>",[],joost,,"[{""name"":""Joost"",""permalink"":""joost""}]",[],"[{""is_past"":false,""title"":""CEO"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Matt"",""last_name"":""Zelesko"",""permalink"":""matt-zelesko""}},{""is_past"":false,""title"":""Co-founder"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Janus"",""last_name"":""Friis"",""permalink"":""janus-friis""}},{""is_past"":false,""title"":""Co-Founder"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Niklas"",""last_name"":""Zennström"",""permalink"":""niklas-zennstrom""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""CEO"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Matthew"",""last_name"":""Zelesko"",""permalink"":""matthew-zelesko""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""CEO"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Mike"",""last_name"":""Volpi"",""permalink"":""mike-volpi""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""CTO"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Dirk-Willem"",""last_name"":""van Gulik"",""permalink"":""dirk-willem-van-gulik""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""SVP of Sales"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Elizabeth"",""last_name"":""Schiff"",""permalink"":""elizabeth-schiff""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""VP, Business Development"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Vipin"",""last_name"":""Goyal"",""permalink"":""vipin-goyal""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""SVP Engineering"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Matt"",""last_name"":""Zelesko"",""permalink"":""matt-zelesko""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""Backend systems architect"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Sylvain"",""last_name"":""Wallez"",""permalink"":""sylvain-wallez""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""Director  of Operations"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Sander"",""last_name"":""van Zoest"",""permalink"":""sander-van-zoest""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""Director of Business Development"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Aki"",""last_name"":""Tsuchiya"",""permalink"":""aki-tsuchiya""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""Product Manager"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Esther"",""last_name"":""Park"",""permalink"":""esther-park""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""Advisor"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Hiro"",""last_name"":""Tamura"",""permalink"":""hiro-tamura""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""Board"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Mark"",""last_name"":""Dyne"",""permalink"":""mark-dyne""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""Senior P2P Software Engineer"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Jens"",""last_name"":""Finkhaeuser"",""permalink"":""jens-finkhaeuser""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""Creative Director"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Mark"",""last_name"":""Webster"",""permalink"":""mark-webster""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""Senior Manager"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Allan"",""last_name"":""Beaufour"",""permalink"":""allan-beaufour""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""Developer"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Kaare"",""last_name"":""Larsen"",""permalink"":""kaare-larsen""}}]",[],"iptv, babelgum, television, video, theveniceproject",$45M,null,Fri Mar 15 23:31:11 UTC 2013,"[{""embed_code"":""<object width=\""425\"" height=\""344\""><param name=\""movie\"" value=\""http://www.youtube.com/v/2W2AZNo_cRI&hl=en&fs=&ap=%2526fmt%3D6\""></param><param name=\""allowFullScreen\"" value=\""true\""></param><param name=\""allowscriptaccess\"" value=\""always\""></param><embed src=\""http://www.youtube.com/v/2W2AZNo_cRI&hl=en&fs=&ap=%2526fmt%3D6\"" type=\""application/x-shockwave-flash\"" allowscriptaccess=\""always\"" allowfullscreen=\""true\"" width=\""425\"" height=\""344\""></embed></object>\r\n<a href=\""SITELINK\""> Joost iPhone App Review - AppVee.com</a>"",""description"":""""},{""embed_code"":""<embed src=\""http://blip.tv/play/goRr3o02AA%2Em4v\"" type=\""application/x-shockwave-flash\"" width=\""370\"" height=\""308\"" allowscriptaccess=\""always\"" allowfullscreen=\""true\""></embed>"",""description"":""<p>This video was originally published on <a href=\""http://www.beet.tv/2008/12/joost-launches.html\"" title=\""Beet.TV\"" rel=\""nofollow\"">Beet.TV</a></p>""}]"

<p>On March 20th 2009 Babelgum released a U.S. version of its mobile video application for iPhone and iPod Touch (previously available in Italy and the UK) and simultaneously launched a redesigned website (www.babelgum.com) with a Flash-based player, offering one of the first fully integrated video mobile and web user experiences.</p>

<p>Babelgum Mobile is currently available in the United States, UK, Italy, Germany, France and Spain and over 50 other countries across the globe on iPhone 3G, iPod Touch, Google Android G-Phones 1 and 2, Nokia (N96, N95 and 6210) via 3G and WiFi.</p>

<p>Babelgum is an independent and privately held company with offices in the United States, UK, Ireland, France and Italy.</p>

<p>TRAFFIC FIGURES</p>

<p>In July 2009 Babelgum recorded on its website over 2 million monthly unique users worldwide â€“ 1.7 million in the US alone (Source: comScore). Over 2 million people have downloaded the Babelgum mobile applications and watched videos on them.</p>

<p>DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY</p>

<p>In Europe, Babelgum made a strategic agreement with Vodafone to launch a mobile service that allows users to watch videos for free also over 3G networks (Vodafone supports marketing campaigns through SMS and other PR activities targeting their Customer Base). Babelgum is also seeking selected strategic partnerships in the United States.</p>

<p>BABELGUMâ€™S EDITORIAL APPROACH TO CONTENT</p>

<p>Positioned between user generated video hubs and network TV-oriented destinations, Babelgum has a unique editorial approach which focuses on the third part of the ecosystem: innovative, professionally produced content on very specific passions curated by experts in their fields. </p>

<p>The editorial team is driven by professional publishers who scout and select programming for the following channels: Music, Comedy, Film, Our Earth (dedicated to nature and the environment) and Metropolis (all about urban culture and trends). </p>

<p>The mobile and web platforms are integrated functionally and graphically and complement each other, although mobile programming is more carefully tailored to local markets, based on research into national tastes and viewing habits. </p>

<p>Babelgumâ€™s content comprises independent and mainstream programming as well as exclusive original productions.</p>

<p>LIST OF MAIN CONTENT PROVIDERS:</p>

<p>Babelgumâ€™s content partners include, among others, EMI, Sony BMG, the New York Times, PBS, BBC, VBS, Lonely Planet, Coolhunting, National Geographic, Funny or Die, T5M, Shine Limited, Cinetic Rights Management, Content Republic, Gong Anime, The Workbook Project, Cinelan, Power to the Pixel and Off the Fence as well as the Seattle, Encounters, Los Angeles, and Hamptons film festivals.</p>

<p>ONLINE VIDEO COMPETITIONS:</p>

<p>According to iLike, it promotes music democracy by exposing artists that users have not heard of, but may like according to their listening habits.  Similar to <a href=""http://crunchbase.com/company/Last.fm"" title=""Last.fm"">Last.fm</a>, iLike catalogs what you listen to through iTunes (and now other players) with a downloadable application.  What users listen to on itunes shows up in their iLike profile in categories defined by quantity and how recent a song has been played.  In addition to displaying your own listening information, iLike tries to match you up with other iLike users who have similar tastes in music.</p>

<p>iLike has links to buy songs or albums from Amazon and iTunes, but also offers free downloads from many independent

Finding itself far behind competitor YouTube in terms of pure user numbers, the company (then grouper) began differentiating its product by changing its architecture.  Originally a downloadable program, grouper became browser based and added a desktop video editor and a closed P2P content distribution element to its arsenal.  With perfect software for a major distributor but a lack of users, Grouper was a prime target for acquisition and was bought by Sony for $65 million, approaching $120 per user by some estimates.  </p>

<p>Reportedly Grouper turned down a $10 million second round of financing to gain the content support of the major media company.  President of Grouper, David Samuel, was no stranger to acquisitions, having sold his old company, Spinner.com, to AOL in 1999 for $320 million.  Grouper was set to become a distribution platform for Sony&#8217;s vast video catalogue, a streaming video site for lower quality video and a place where fans could make mashups of Sony Content.</p>

<p>Grouper was quiet for a while after its acquisition, however, it was reborn Crackle after a complete overhaul of its website in July of 2007.  Crackle is now a destination video site for professional producers and anyone hoping to become one.  Crackle consists of 12 channels which range in flavor from animation to news.  Crackle is ad supported.</p>

With approximately 9,500 Aniboom Animators located around the globe we deliver every type of animation to major brands and entertainment companies worldwide.</p>

<p>Our methodology is different. </p>

<p>There is an evolution happening today in animation. The costs of running a production house with talented artists located close to a major studio is not cost effective, so work is often being outsourced â€“ but even then there are brick and mortar costs involved in addition to a loss of control. Aniboom uses the power of the Cloud in animation production to lower costs, increase speed and raise transparency. </p>

<p>Aniboom is an online production studio that makes animation by reaching out to our database of over 9,500 creators who are located around the globe. Aniboom&#8217;s massive workforce allows it to find multiple perfect creators for any job. Interested in double redundancy? Done. Triple? Aniboom can do that too. Even quadruple. Due to the amount of qualified creators we can draw from, and the level of quality talent within, Aniboom is more flexible and scalable than a traditional studio. The Aniboom Virtual Studio online production platform allows us to review work in near real-time. And, our more efficient cost structure allows production at better rates than traditional brick-and-mortar studios.</p>

<p>Founded in 2006 by television industry veterans Uri Shinar and Avraham Pirchi.

Revver was founded in 2004 before user generated video had even begun to take off.  For months into its infancy Revver looked to be a viable alternative if not legitimate challenger to YouTube.  Its 50/50 revenue share model landed some high profile content like Ask a Ninja, LonelyGirl15 and the Diet Coke and Mentos guys.  Users were immediately enticed by the chance not only to be a web celebrity but to make some cash while they were at it.  </p>

<p>According to Compete.com, Revver page views are still growing, however, they hit appr. 1 million monthly while YouTube achieves close to 250 million.

<p>Fanning, Mendelson and Conway founded SNOCAP in the days immediately following Napster&#8217;s demise. Many of the company&#8217;s employees, including its COO, <a href=""http://crunchbase.com/person/ali-aydar"" title=""Ali Aydar"">Ali Aydar</a>, were veterans of the original Napster team.</p>

<p>SNOCAP&#8217;s initial focus was on developing technology content owners (in particular artists and labels) could use to register their content and set business rules controlling where and how that content is available on the web. SNOCAP eventually secured deals with all four major labels (Universal Music Group, EMI, Warner Music Group, and SonyBMG Music Entertainment) to register their content in SNOCAP&#8217;s digital registry. </p>

<p>SNOCAP&#8217;s ultimate goal was to license this technology to file-sharing services, enabling a new wave of &#8220;legal P2P&#8221; services that used SNOCAP&#8217;s technology to track and filter music sharing within a network, blocking registered content that labels &amp; artists didn&#8217;t want shared but allowing sharing of anything else. While two file-sharing services, Mashboxx and Grokster, signed up to use SNOCAP&#8217;s technology, their SNOCAP-powered services never launched.</p>

<p>In late 2006, SNOCAP and <a href=""http://crunchbase.com/company/myspace"" title=""MySpace"">MySpace</a> announced that they were partnering to give independent artists and labels a way to sell music on MySpace through SNOCAPâ€™s MyStore widgets. Eventually, over 110,000 artists signed up to sell their music through MyStore widgets. These early experiments were a precursor to MySpaceâ€™s efforts to sell downloads directly to consumers through its <a href=""http://crunchbase.com/company/myspace-music"" title=""MySpace Music"">MySpace Music</a> venture. </p>

<p>In March 2007, SNOCAP announced it was partnering with the social media site <a href=""http://crunchbase.com/company/imeem"" title=""imeem"">imeem</a> to track music being played on the site and share ad revenue with artists and labels, utilizing SNOCAPâ€™s content fingerprinting and digital registry technology. The goal was to provide a way for consumers to upload and share music with their friends, for free, and to do so in a way where label and artists can both make money and have greater control over where and how their music was available. imeem rolled out this new offering in June 2007.</p>

<p>In April 2008, imeem acquired SNOCAP, confirming rumors first reported on TechCrunch two months earlier. That acquisition reunited several members of the original Napster team, including SNOCAP&#8217;s then COO, Ali Aydar, who is now imeemâ€™s COO. Aydar was a key early advisor to imeem and served on its board of directors from 2003-2007.</p>

<p>imeem continues to operate the SNOCAP digital registry, and uses the technology acquired from SNOCAP to power imeemâ€™s ad-supported streaming music service.</p>

<p>SNOCAP was backed by Ron Conway, Morgenthaler Ventures, WaldenVC, and Court Square Ventures. In total, the company raised over $25 million in funding from WaldenVC, Morgenthaler Ventures, and Court Square Ventures.</p>",[],snocap,,"[{""name"":""Snocap"",""permalink"":""snocap""}]",[],"[{""is_past"":false,""title"":""CFO"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Peter"",""last_name"":""Maloney"",""permalink"":""peter-maloney""}},{""is_past"":false,""title"":""VP Marketing and Public Relations"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Bruce"",""last_name"":""Taylor"",""permalink"":""bruce-taylor""}},{""is_past"":false,""title"":""VP Product Management"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Karin"",""last_name"":""Visnick"",""permalink"":""karin-visnick""}},{""is_past"":false,""title"":""General Counsel"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Richard"",""last_name"":""Mosher"",""permalink"":""richard-mosher""}},{""is_past"":false,""title"":""Director of Performance, Productivity & Peopl"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Yvonne"",""last_name"":""Sommerfeld"",""permalink"":""yvonne-sommerfeld""}},{""is_past"":false,""title"":""Board"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Art"",""last_name"":""Berliner"",""permalink"":""art-berliner""}},{""is_past"":false,""title"":""VP Corporate & Business Development"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Alex"",""last_name"":""Rofman"",""permalink"":""alex-rofman""}},{""is_past"":false,""title"":""Head of Music Development"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Chris"",""last_name"":""Campbell"",""permalink"":""chris-campbell""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""Chairman, Board of Directors"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Jeff"",""last_name"":""Mallett"",""permalink"":""jeff-mallett""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""CEO"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Rusty"",""last_name"":""Rueff"",""permalink"":""rusty-rueff""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""Founder, CTO"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Shawn"",""last_name"":""Fanning"",""permalink"":""shawn-fanning""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""CTO, VP Engineering"",""person"":{""first_name"":""David"",""last_name"":""Rowley"",""permalink"":""double-rowley""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""CTO & VP Engineering"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Dave"",""last_name"":""Rowley"",""permalink"":""dave-rowley""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""Founder & Chief Architect"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Jordan"",""last_name"":""Mendelson"",""permalink"":""jordan-mendelson""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":"""",""person"":{""first_name"":""Ali"",""last_name"":""Aydar"",""permalink"":""ali-aydar""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""Design Director"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Stefanie"",""last_name"":""Kraus"",""permalink"":""stefanie-kraus""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""Chief Operating Officer"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Ali"",""last_name"":""Aydar"",""permalink"":""ali-aydar""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""Chief Advancement Officer"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Rex"",""last_name"":""Ishibashi"",""permalink"":""rex-ishibashi-2""}}]",[],"musicdistribution, p2p, imeem, al-aydar, shawn-fanning, napster, myspace, myspace-music, fingerprinting, content-management, dalton-caldwell",$25M,null,Fri Nov 06 01:17:57 UTC 2009,[]

<p>Fantasy players have to make decisions before plays actually start. They awarded varying amounts of points depending on the play they choose, with more rare or difficult plays earning more points.  </p>

<p>Founder Kris Billmaier used to play an informal version of YouBeQB with friends during football games, but decided to develop it into an actual online game.

<p>Battleground features 3 modes of competitive gaming; Instant Action (24/7 death match styled play), Challenges (direct wagering between users or clans) and Tournaments (multi-ladder, automated tournament system) supported by a full virtual eco-system of Xcoin (paid currency) and Battle Tokens (earned currency). </p>

The Magnify Video Platform supports over 100,000+ sites, with over 30+ million video views per month. </p>

<p>Magnify.net supports video discovery, curation and video delivery through a web based platform that includes encoding/transcoding, storage, hosting &amp; CDN delivery.</p>

<p>Users can upload video to their channels using video URLs or by searching for video from the Magnify.net site. Videos are searchable by text, tags or reviews. The approach is different than most video sites that depend on users to upload their own content.  </p>

<p>Magnify.net allows channel publishers to set permission for channel viewers, so channel viewers can upload their own relevant videos to the channel. This allows for interaction between website publishers and their readers (or viewers). </p>

<p>Magnify has two ways to acquire their Platform;  Pro, &amp; Enterprise. With Pro being targeted at small communities and the small business market, and Enterprise is for large publishers such as <a href=""http://www.videos.nymag.com"" title=""New York Magazine"" rel=""nofollow"">New York Magazine</a>, and Mediaite (http://www.videos.mediaite.com).</p>

In the month of August, Nielsen's\r\nVideoCensus reported that Hulu delivered nearly 108 million video\r\nstreams, ranking Hulu as the overall No. 8 brand based on video streams.\r\n\r\nTo accommodate a continuously growing content library, Hulu has also\r\nimproved discoverability on the service. Hulu.com today implemented a\r\nnumber of features including genre-based browsing, show recommendations,\r\nuser discussion forums for specific programs or episodes, enhanced\r\nactor-based searching and improved queue management.\r\n\r\nGenre-based channels allow users to more easily find their favorites and\r\ndiscover new ones.

<p>Media companies, content and niche social networks, and aggregators need ways to promote more interaction, conversation and discussion in their sites between experts, professionals, visitors and community members. Many content oriented sites simply allow visitors to post data, media, and comments. There is no real-time communication or discussion around the content within these sites, or the direct ability for members to communicate. These sites also need to maintain their visitors experience and association with their brand and content, while considering how to further the interaction within their sites. Additionally, these sites need ways to draw additional visitors proactively and through their core user base.</p>

<p>To that end, ekko provides media companies, content-oriented social networks, and aggregators with a hosted, modular and customizable platform to enable multi-user communication and discussion right within their sites. Using any or all of the ekko platform modules, sites can provide their communities a branded experience with active conversation through broadcast discussions, text (IM), video and/or audio. The modules encourage activity, increasing time spent on the site, and draw new users to the site, simultaneously. The modules include: IM aggregator, white label site-specific IM server, video chat application, shared video player and more. The platform is easily implemented into sites by simply dropping in a few lines of code.

The Hollywood.com Advertising Group, a leading entertainment vertical ad network, includes Hollywood.com, Movietickets.com, and other entertainment outlets encompassing nearly one hundred celebrity fan sites. \r\n\r\nWith over fifteen years of advertising sales experience, the Hollywood.com Advertising Group offers entertainment-focused relationships with advertisers as well as a network of niche entertainment sites.  Now, with the avid FilmCrave.com movie fan base, advertisers will have a greater ability to supply targeted ads to reach the ultimate entertainment consumer.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe are very excited to sell ads for FilmCrave.com.  They have one of most innovative sites online.

In addition, FilmCrave.com does not rely on social applications or third party social networks to drive user interests but rather focuses on the core movie user experience.   \r\n\r\nâ€œWith Hollywood.comâ€™s partnership, FilmCrave.com will be the first social network in which advertisements actually enhance the website, rather than detract,â€ says Josh Collins, FilmCrave.com co-founder.  â€œBy creating ad zones based off more than just the areas on the site users visit, such as secure user data, ratings, and favorite genres, a user will be greeted with a unique experience that will not detract from the community.â€\r\n\r\nWith the ad sales team in place, FilmCrave is actively seeking investments from Venture Capitalists, Angel Investors, and potential partners.  As the up-and-coming movie social network to watch, FilmCrave.comâ€™s assets include unsurpassed web site usability, a customized feature set including their popular movie lists, incredible member loyalty, and now, online advertisements and branding to further enhance their service offering.\r\n\r\nâ€œHaving traveled this far without either funding or quality advertisements, itâ€™s nice to have solidified revenue generation,â€ notes Alex Olson, co-founder. â€œNow, weâ€™re focused on solidifying the investment.â€\r\n\r\nAbout FilmCrave.com:\r\n\r\nAs a niche based social media site, they allow members to create organized top movie lists and write helpful movie reviews while at the same time integrating with social networking functions.

Open games are listed in a lobby, where players can sign up in groups ranging from 4 to 10 players each paying into a prize pool. DraftMix also ponies up a nightly cash prize for a free game as well.</p>

<p>When a game is full, players pick their teams from active profession players. Each fantasy manager&#8217;s team is scored on their players stats in the upcoming &#8220;real world&#8221; games. Since stats are needed to find the winning team, the time it takes to finish a game varies by sport. Football fantasy games are finished weekly, since all the teams play each Sunday. Basketball can finish a bit faster since teams play daily. The manager with the most points wins the money pot, with 10% of real cash games going to DraftMix.</p>

<p>Now all this may sound fine playing fantasy sports for fantasy dollars, but doesn&#8217;t bringing real money into play amount to internet gambling? No, says co-founder Matt Maroon, who points the the fantasy sports exemption in the <a href=""http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h109-4411"" title=""Internet Gambling Prohibition and Enforcement Act"" rel=""nofollow"">Internet Gambling Prohibition and Enforcement Act</a>. The act, which was a big blow to sites like PartyPoker, specifically exempts &#8220;participation in any fantasy or simulation sports game or educational game or contest&#8221;. Fantasy sports is seen as a game of skill and played for a fixed cash prize. Although a quick perusal of the exemption leaves feeling they&#8217;re at least bending the rules.</p>

Motionbox doesn&#8217;t have a client uploader like Crackle (formerly Grouper) and VideoEgg. Users must upload the full video files to the service. Like YouTube, Motionbox transcodes files to flash to reduce file size and standardize viewing. But they also store the original files and allow users (and those authorized) to download those files and/or purchase DVDs with the files. </p>

<p>Video editing is a pleasure on Motionbox. When editing a video, Motionbox breaks it down visually into frames. Users can edit the file extensively, including linking several video files and removing any portions of files. Mashups with other users&#8217; public or shared videos can also be created using Motionbox&#8217;s extensive editing features. </p>

<p>All of these changes can be pushed back to the original quality files for downloading or DVD burning. Like YouTube and other services, Motionbox allows tagging of video files. But they also allow deep tagging of parts of video files. Users can open a file, select a portion of the video, and tag it. Viewers are able to skip right to that clip of the video by clicking on the tag. Longer videos can now easily be broken down into linkable pieces. </p>

<p>Motionbox began supporting high definition video in March 2008.</p>

Based in France, and serving customers throughout the world, PriceMinister.com is a global online marketplace for connecting buyers and sellers. PriceMinister.com is the second most popular e-commerce site in France and in the top 15 of all French websites overall. \r\n\r\nWith over 8 million members, PriceMinister.com is an online marketplace for books, CDs, DVDs and games, electronic goods, childcare, fashion, home and garden, automobiles and many other products. Every month, over 30 million people visit the site to buy and sell. Currently there are over 120 million products listed on the site, each with their own graphics and images. Panther delivers those images and graphics.\r\n\r\nFirst launched in 2001, PriceMinister.com has worked with some of the worldâ€™s biggest and most well known content delivery networks. In January 2008, they decided to move to Panther Express to smoothly and reliably deliver the siteâ€™s graphic elements and millions of product images. They also needed a CDN that could scale and provide extremely reliable, fast delivery through Europe as well as globally.\r\n\r\nâ€œBy using the Panther Express and its unique Origin Shielding service, we get many fewer requests on our origin servers thereby greatly reducing the load on our database and improving overall site speed and responsiveness,â€ said Justin Ziegler, co-founder and CTO of PriceMinister.com. â€œThe Panther interface is very simple and easy for our team to use and manage. In addition, we are very impressed by the Panther support teamâ€™s responsiveness and professionalism. Whenever we have a question or an issue, they get answers to us quickly.â€ \r\n\r\nâ€œToday, e-commerce is a global phenomenon. It doesnâ€™t matter where you are based, in the United States, in France, or on an island somewhere, you must be sure your content delivery network provides consistent high quality and reliability worldwide,â€ said Gad Stanislas, Vice President - International of Panther. â€œPriceMinister.com recognizes that a CDN has to deliver more than just high performance and competitive pricing â€“ they need to provide worldwide connectivity, an easy to use management interface as well as a network architecture that minimizes the requests on the content providerâ€™s origin servers.â€\r\nPanther Express Shielding Service\r\n\r\nWhen users make a request to a cache that does not have the object, the cache makes an HTTP request back to the origin web server. By using the Shielding Service, this request is instead first directed to the Shield POP, rather than going directly to the origin web server. Reducing the load on origin server eliminates the need for capital investment for larger origin servers. Panther Express Shielding can also improve performance because the Shield caches have a proportionately large amount of provisioned bandwidth and are usually closer to POPs than the origin. Shielding also provides redundancy as objects are stored in the cache and will be delivered, even if the origin is down \r\n\r\nAbout PriceMinister\r\nPriceMinister.com (http://www.priceminister.com) is an online marketplace for buyers and sellers that also acts as trusted third party. PriceMinister.com guarantees that the seller is paid and, second, that the buyer is satisfied. PriceMinister.com introduced its â€œsecured direct sales from sellers to buyersâ€ platform in 2001 in France, and in 2006 in Spain. In five years PriceMinister.com expanded to support the sales of books, CDs, DVDs and games, electronic goods, childcare, fashion, home and garden, automobiles and many other products.\r\n\r\nAbout 30 million people visit the site each month, 120 million products are for sale, and PriceMinister.com now has 8 million members. Since its launch, the site has enjoyed a three-digit growth rate and is targeting the top position in e-commerce in France. PriceMinister.com was founded in August 2000 by Pierre Kosciusko-Morizet, Pierre Krings, Justin Ziegler and Olivier Mathiot. Investors include 3i, Quilvest and private individuals. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Panther Express\r\n\r\n\r\nPanther Express Corp. is the industryâ€™s best value CDN solution - a high-performance content delivery network (CDN) with an innovative low-cost infrastructure.

<p>This is done via a two step process. First the site harnesses the &#8220;Wisdom of Crowds&#8221; to objectively identify the best new artists. The top 2% of artists are then showcased on the site and every artist/band who attracts sufficient support from investors and fans goes forward to raise $30,000 to professionally record and release an album.</p>

<p>Investors can then trade in and out of their Contracts in artists they have invested in on a fully fledged trading exchange hosted on the site. The ultimate payout on Contracts is directly proportional to the number of singles and albums sold over a 2 year period.</p>

<p>Artists keep all of their copyright and publishing rights, paying a royalty to Slicethepie on the first two years of album sales.

<p>Musical notes can elicit diverse emotions and each emotion can be mapped to a color. So when someone is looking for soothing music, they may be more likely to pick softer colors and in the same way, softer-colored music. In the same vein, Guitarati users can follow their instinct by picking colors and quickly find music they actually like. While they listen to a song, they can also mark it with various colors they are intuitively attracted to. Each song thus has a dominant color, resulting from collective color markings.</p>

<p>The music is offered in DRM free mp3 format. Users can listen to 192 kbps or better full-length songs or free samples. They pay 1 cent for each full-length song streaming, and these cents get deducted from the download price when they download the song.</p>

<p>Guitarati provides multiple revenue streams for bands and labels, as they get paid for song downloads as well as streaming. They decide the price of their music and retain 75% of the earnings. Record labels can manage their entire roster and earnings through a single dashboard.

Unlike on-demand services for pre-recorded materials where viewing requests are spread over time, live services result in concentrated demand from a potentially huge audience, just for the duration of the event. As a consequence, event organizers are often forced to compromise quality or limit audience sizes when using conventional live streaming services.\r\n\r\nHybrid-P2P Streaming blends delivery of live streams from the Velocix Network caches as well as sharing bandwidth from peers. Each participant is not only watching or listening to the live broadcast but is effectively relaying the signal to the other audience members (peers) at the same time. This community distribution process is managed in real-time by sophisticated control and routing algorithms hosted on the Velocix Network, ensuring required service levels and an uninterrupted experience for the entire audience.\r\n\r\nThe Velocix Network is designed to enable content owners, studios, and broadcasters to deliver video and other large digital assets, such as software, games and audio over the web, with unprecedented performance, breakthrough economics and an asset delivery lifecycle management system that provides content owners the control, analytics and reporting they need to manage their asset libraries through the digital distribution chain."",""source_description"":""Velocix Acquires Exclusive License of RawFlow Live Streaming P2P Technology"",""stoneable_type"":""Company"",""stoned_value"":null,""stoned_value_type"":null,""stoned_acquirer"":null,""stoneable"":{""name"":""Velocix"",""permalink"":""velocix""}},{""id"":1867,""description"":""Alcatel-Lucent Acquires CDN Technology Provider Velocix"",""stoned_year"":2009,""stoned_month"":7,""stoned_day"":30,""source_url"":""http://blog.streamingmedia.com/the_business_of_online_vi/2009/07/alcatellucent-acquires-cdn-technology-provider-velocix.html"",""source_text"":null,""source_description"":""ALU acquires Velocix"",""stoneable_type"":""Company"",""stoned_value"":null,""stoned_value_type"":null,""stoned_acquirer"":null,""stoneable"":{""name"":""Velocix"",""permalink"":""velocix""}}]",Velocix,null,"[{""description"":""Corporate Headquarters"",""address1"":""326 Cambridge Science Park"",""address2"":"""",""zip_code"":""CB4 0WG"",""city"":""Cambridge"",""state_code"":null,""country_code"":""GBR"",""latitude"":null,""longitude"":null},{""description"":""New York Office"",""address1"":""1230 Avenue of the Americas"",""address2"":"""",""zip_code"":""10020"",""city"":""New York"",""state_code"":""NY"",""country_code"":""USA"",""latitude"":40.758504,""longitude"":-73.980068}]","<p>Velocix offers a broad range of advanced digital delivery services for live and on demand streaming video streaming and file download. </p>

Sites like Last.fm have music suggestions, artists profile, and communities covered, the iTunes and Amazon music stores make purchasing a breeze, and music videos can be found littered across Youtube.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s time to make room for one more, and it has the potential to be big.  Pluggedin, a music video and community site that sees itself as a Hulu for music, launched in public beta on April 15, 2008.  The site&#8217;s biggest selling point is its high quality video content, featuring music videos from labels including EMI, Sony BMG, and Universal Music Group, along with a number of independent labels.  Pluggedin is hoping to add the last of the &#8216;big four&#8217; labels, Warner Music, in the near future.</p>

<p>The Hulu comparison is an apt one.  The site is very clean, video quality is generally much better than what&#8217;s found on Youtube, and the amount of content is impressive, though there are some noticeable gaps.  At launch the site features over 10,000 available videos, but most of them are not available in true HD quality (largely because existing footage is not hi-def).  Pluggedin hopes that as the site gains popularity, content providers will have a greater incentive to film music videos in HD.</p>

<p>Pluggedin does a good job integrating with other sites on the web.  Users are provided with direct links to Amazon and iTunes if they&#8217;d like to purchase a video or song they&#8217;ve just listened to.    And the site has formed a number of partnerships with merchandisers, including Hot Topic for clothing and Thumbplay for mobile ringtones.  All of this is presented in unobtrusive menus that don&#8217;t detract from the experience at all. </p>

<p>The site also features profiles for over a million musicians, including those that don&#8217;t have any videos on the site.  Profiles are dynamically generated using content from a number of sources, including All Music Guide, Last.FM, and Wikipedia.  And while these pages don&#8217;t feature any &#8216;HD-quality&#8217; material, they do provide a list of each artist&#8217;s music videos found elsewhere on the internet, all of which play seamlessly in the page. </p>

<p>Despite all of these features, the site still has a few issues.  Searching for specific videos can be tricky - it seems that users can only search by artist name, not song title.  And for a site that promotes its video quality, there are surprisingly few videos available in HD at launch (though this is mostly a fault of content providers).  </p>

<p>PluggedIn looks like it could really explode.  The social networking aspect is minimal, but sufficient for sharing music between friends.  It&#8217;s a great timewaster - clicking through random music has never been this fun.  And the playlist feature be will great for impromptu parties.  As long as PluggedIn continues to add content and doesn&#8217;t go overboard with their ads, this site will be one to watch.</p>

CEDR leverages what we call &#8220;cluster-in-cloud computing&#8221; in order to radically transform this life-cycle from a cost-intensive, geographically specific, and hardware-dependent process to a cost efficient, decentralized, and software based process that resides in the &#8220;cloud.&#8221; CEDR has been developed by SIVOO and is proprietary to the Company.</p>

<p>CEDR creates digital video assets from any format or source including Satellite, Internet stream, hard media, or digital file; encodes captured video into any and/or multiple specifications like CableLabs, Flash, Windows Media, Quicktime, H.264, MPEG2, etc.; distributes these assets to any IP video or broadcast distribution outlet; and tracks the views and monetization of assets in a single report.</p>

<p>With CEDR, video assets are easily and automatically managed and distributed by and between MSOs, content aggregators, and distribution outlets. CEDR allows customers to pull video assets between locations as either a file or as a stream-link on the Internet Edge. CEDR can also push video assets to Internet sites like YouTube and MetaCafe, mobile platforms like Verizon V-Cast, IPTV providers like Verizon FIOS TV and Verismo, and cable companies like Comcast.</p>

<p>CEDR distribution outlets include AOL, Brightcove, Charter Communications, eyespot, Grouper, Guba, HotWire, iFilm, iTunes Podcasts, Joost, jumpcut, JumpTV, MediaMelon, MetaCafe, MobiTV, MySpace, SES Americom, Terra, Verismo, Verizon FIOS TV, Verizon V-Cast, Videoegg, Vimeo, VOY, VSocial, and YouTube. SIVOO is actively growing its distribution reach.</p>

<p>SIVOO earns fees from processing video through CEDR and shares in the advertising revenue generated by views across CEDR distribution outlets. </p>",[],sivoo,(215) 592-0483,[],[],[],[],"video, web-video, video-distribution",$0,null,Sat Jan 19 04:14:55 UTC 2013,[]

It then launched a version of the same game on the popular Brazilian social network Orkut in October 2009. More recently, Vostu launched a farming game on Orkut called &#8220;Mini Fazenda&#8221; which as of January 31, 2010 had 8 million monthly active users and was rated the #1 social game on the Orkut platform.</p>

<p>Vostu was started by Daniel Kafie, Mario Schlosser and Josh Kushner while they were students at Harvard University. As of February 2010, Vostu is a private company with offices in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, and New York. The company is venture-backed by Intel Capital who led a $1.3M seed round in early 2008 and a follow-on investment in November 2009 for an undisclosed amount. </p>

Many of these videos have\r\nhad over 25 millions views. However, until today there has been no easy way for a\r\nperson viewing a music video to simply click on the video and purchase the song or a\r\nringtone from the video. Soundflavor and Veeple have created a simple way for\r\nmusicians to place interactive actions into their music videos and directly link to a\r\npurchase. Further, the in-stream interactions, what Veeple calls VeeSpots, also allow\r\nviewers to click to a musicianâ€™s web site, iTunes, eBay, MySpace or Facebook.\r\nâ€œThe people at Soundflavor are excited to have this cool, new functionality for our\r\ncommunity, said Steve Skrzyniarz, Soundflavorâ€™s CEO and Founder. Steve continued,\r\nâ€œThis will let people click directly from a video to our site where they can purchase the\r\nsong or a ringtone, or find music playlists that match user preferences.â€\r\nâ€œWe hope this new capability will help bring together the community of musicians and\r\ntheir listeners in such a way that many more people will purchase the music they listen to\r\non-line. To be able to go from a music video to music purchase is really cool,â€ said Scott\r\nBroomfield, Veepleâ€™s CEO and Co-Founder.\r\nAbout Soundflavor\r\nSoundflavor, Inc. is a digital music company providing industry-leading music search and\r\ndiscovery products to both music professionals and consumers.

Its Soundflavor Music Recommendation Engine\r\npowers the Companyâ€™s Soundflavor DJ product and is available for licensing to enable\r\nconsumer and commercial music companies to provide their customers with the ability to\r\ndiscover, sample, and purchase music more efficiently.

Pixar began as the computer graphics project of the Computer Division at Lucasfilm Ltd, created in 1979. The Computer Division was led by Ed Catmull and the graphics project (soon called Pixar) was run by Alvy Ray Smith. Pixar was a hardware company developing highend image processing tools - in particular the Pixar 2D Frame Buffer. In 1984 they hired John Lasseter to help them produce their first animated film, primarily to demonstrate the power of their hardware. Over the years Lasseter created more animated shorts to demonstrate the Pixar, in 1986 creating Luxo Jr. Pixar was spun out of Lucasfilm and was purchased by <a href=""/person/steve-jobs"" title=""Steve Jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">Steve Jobs</a> in 1986, at which point it became an independent company, although still a hardware company, and run by Ed Catmull and Alvy Ray Smith. Failing to grow the hardware business, they became increasingly dependent on revenue from their animated projects, first doing commercials. Eventually they made a deal with Disney to produce the first full-length feature film entirely in CG. Jobs was not very focused on Pixar, and was trying to sell it in the early 90s.

<p>FABINET is built for two main groups of professionals. The first group is formed by authors/creators who offer ideas (not only scriptwriters, all who involved in business). The second group is producers and broadcast stations&#8217; representatives.  </p>

<p>FABINET is not a public, but strictly professional domain. In other words, people from the street would not be able to get into our database. We work with experienced lawyers who will legally confirm the authors&#8217; rights and monitor the projects. There is an experienced lawyer working with us in Berlin to issue copyright licenses for our members and one firm here in Leipzig, declaring our rights and confirming other legal issues. What we offer at FABINET is a unique opportunity to expose all kinds of ideas strictly within the professional community, with the assurance that they are safe from theft and plagiarism. </p>

<p>FABINET is a virtual meeting ground, where film and video production specialists can come together to share concerns and ideas and look for like-minded people. Fabinet offers an opportunity to meet potential partners with whom to mount productions.</p>

<p>We strongly encourage people to post the most innovative projects — the ones you&#8217;ve never dared to promote. The space authors use for projects will serve as your permanent presentation sites: post vita, professional credits and future plans, and allow them to reveal their creativity.</p>

<p>FABNET&#8217;s mission is to connect people who are desperately looking for fresh ideas with a uniquely creative community. We also multiply the chances for everyone to expose some creativity to international community. FABINET helps with legal advisors on board who constantly monitor project submission and secure authors&#8217; rights as creators. We plan to organize consulting and script reviewing of newcomers by well-known professional, online chat rooms for immediate help and seminars. It&#8217;s all about helping people.

The partnership launches with the integration of a Lexy subscription button into the Onion Radio News (ORN) webpage. This button provides easy access to Lexy, giving fans of ORN a new and effortless way to listen to the ORN daily broadcast and share it with their friends, while also providing The Onion with an excellent opportunity to grow its mobile listenership.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\nSimilar to other distribution buttons (e.g., RSS, iTunes) and like an RSS feed, Lexy immediately updates each subscriber's playlist with the latest ORN broadcast. However, unlike traditional RSS readers, Lexy subscribers can access this audio programming on their mobile phones, not just on their PCs, and share individual broadcasts with friends -- instantly from phone to phone.\r\n\r\nWith a name that combines the words Lexicon and Sexy, Lexy is both pragmatic and fun. Founded by Egreetings Network creators, Fred Campbell and Tony Levitan, Lexy is an innovative audio content distribution solution that fosters consumer interactions, is device- and carrier-independent, and reaches 100% of the mobile phone market. Lexy offers subscribers a wealth of audio programming, some culled from the very best short-form podcasts available online and some created in-house. Lexy also provides the capability to share and discuss audio content with others, all with a remarkably simple audio interface.\r\n\r\n\""We are thrilled to launch Lexy formally with a premier media outlet like The Onion,\"" said Lexy co-founder Tony Levitan. \""Their distinctive brand of humor and irreverence, as well as their commitment to multi-platform distribution, makes them an ideal partner for an innovative company like Lexy.\""\r\n\r\n\""Lexy expands the distribution of Doyle Redland's award-winning radio journalism onto mobile phones around the globe,\"" said Steve Hannah, CEO, The Onion, \""First, the Onion Radio News conquered the AM Dial.

<p>Today popular online games, like World of Warcraft and Everquest, allow players to explore large and vast fantasy worlds, however they require huge time commitments and are considered &#8220;isolated&#8221; in their walled gardens. The games created by Shattered Reality provide &#8220;theme-based&#8221; and &#8220;hit-based&#8221; accomplishment for both the hardcore and casual gamers. What&#8217;s great about us is that we leverage the hardcore gaming production values and bridge the gap for online social games. </p>

<p>The first title to be released is, Legends of Kaos (LoK), a free 2 play multiplayer ancient sci-fi fantasy that combines the head-to-head play, collectability and trading associated with virtual powers and collectible action items. We also leverage level advancement and character development of massively multi-player games (MMORPGs) with the ease of access and community aspects of Web &#8220;two-point-oh&#8221; applications. LoK will also be available on Facebook and Myspace. LoK and other games developed by Shattered Reality are free 2 play. Players have the option to trade or sell items to other players and they can even sign up for VIP memberships for a small subscription fee.</p>",[],shattered-reality-interactive,,[],[],"[{""is_past"":false,""title"":"""",""person"":{""first_name"":""Bo"",""last_name"":""Lasater"",""permalink"":""bo-lasater""}},{""is_past"":false,""title"":"""",""person"":{""first_name"":""Steve"",""last_name"":""Matthews"",""permalink"":""steve-matthews""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""Founder & CEO"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Damon"",""last_name"":""Grow"",""permalink"":""damon-grow""}}]",[],"techcrunch50, tc50, games, mmo, social, online, casual-games",$1.1M,,Mon Oct 21 06:04:40 UTC 2013,"[{""embed_code"":""<embed src=\""http://blip.tv/play/9izNyQ2G4R0\"" type=\""application/x-shockwave-flash\"" width=\""320\"" height=\""255\"" allowscriptaccess=\""always\"" allowfullscreen=\""true\""></embed> "",""description"":""<p>tc50</p>""}]"

Users record what they play and mix it with the song, then use advanced editing and sound effect tools to clean it up.  Mass collaboration has been utilized in text (Wikipedia) and software (Firefox).

The big original vision was to create a theme based Massive Multiplayer Online Game that could be played in 5-10 minute time increments anytime, from anywhere.</p>

<p>Today popular online games, like World of Warcraft and Everquest, allow players to explore large and vast fantasy worlds, however they require huge time commitments and are considered &#8220;isolated&#8221; in their walled gardens. The games created by Shattered Reality provide &#8220;theme-based&#8221; and &#8220;hit-based&#8221; accomplishment for both the hardcore and casual gamers. What&#8217;s great about us is that we leverage the hardcore gaming production values and bridge the gap for online social games. </p>

<p>The first title to be released is, Legends of Kaos (LoK), a free 2 play multiplayer ancient sci-fi fantasy that combines the head-to-head play, collectability and trading associated with virtual powers and collectible action items. We also leverage level advancement and character development of massively multi-player games (MMORPGs) with the ease of access and community aspects of Web &#8220;two-point-oh&#8221; applications. LoK will also be available on Facebook and Myspace. LoK and other games developed by Shattered Reality are free 2 play.

<p>Play Games, Go Shopping, Throw Parties for Causes in Hangout
Teen girls (and later guys) create their own personalized avatars, play casual mini-games, go shopping, throw parties for their friends, or just hangout.  Playing games earns money for fashionable looks, new moves on the dance floor, or money to give to charity.  At launch, players will be able to begin building their fashion empire as they level up to become a top fashion designer.  Soon they can also aspire to become a dance master or the ultimate chef in order to throw the party of a lifetime, all in the name of a real charity of their choice.  Hangout is about having fun with friends, meeting new people, and making a difference!</p>

<p>Hangout Uniquely Integrates Social Games with a Virtual World
Each game we publish seamlessly plugs into the same virtual world, so players keep their avatars, possessions, and status from game to game.

<p>The Problem</p>

<p>Companies spend billions of dollars each year on training and coaching-in 2006 over $129 billion. However, this training is often ineffective or very expensive or both. </p>

<p>Ineffective-Studies show that after 4 weeks, 85% of what was learned in a classroom setting is forgotten. Additionally, teaching interpersonal and communication skills in a classroom environment is rarely effective. Lastly, scheduling conflicts often cause inefficiency and delay in connecting a person in need of coaching and a coach. </p>

<p>Expensive - Companies spend money on travel, lodging, meals and other related costs in order to get people to training sessions. Companies also deploy e-learning solutions which offer little or no interaction or practice and suffer from miserable completion rates.</p>

<p>Additionally, current market conditions have caused the majority of enterprises to cut training and travel budgets significantly and look for cost effective means to deliver training enterprise-wide.</p>

<p>The Solution</p>

<p>SureSpeak is a Software as a Service (SaaS) provider of web-based video coaching platform and tools. Executive coaches &amp; enterprises use SureSpeak to improve sales, presentation and communication skills leading to enhanced revenues, higher customer retention and improved operating efficiencies. SureSpeak users watch modeling videos that demonstrate desired performance â€“ for example â€œHow to close the saleâ€. Then with just an internet connection and a webcam, the user records their version and self-reviews. Typically the user will re-record multiple times until satisfied (current record to save ratio is 6:1). Practicing or role-playing in a private setting has proven to be very desirable for SureSpeak users as opposed to group role-playing which is embarrassing and counter-productive. When the user is satisfied with his â€œSureSpeakâ€ he saves, and his coach receives an automatic email alert notifying him that a SureSpeak is waiting for review. The coach then logs in from wherever he may be and whenever he has time. This is a key to the efficiency of SureSpeak. The coach provides feedback in written form, in score format â€“ based on customizable categories such as â€œbody languageâ€, â€œtoneâ€, â€œenthusiasmâ€, â€œmessage contentâ€, â€œsincerityâ€, etc. The coach also can record a video back to the user. When the coach saves his feedback the system notifies the user that his score SureSpeak has been reviewed, and likewise the user logs in when convenient to review. Additionally, each user can receive feedback from unlimited coaches, peers, managers, etc.</p>

<p>SureSpeakâ€™s patented platform is unique in that it is asynchronous â€“ meaning the practice and coaching is split up into 3 distinct parts â€“ practice, coaching/feedback, and review of feedback. These can be done independent of each other without delay and at any time. Most training fails in that no video record is provided and if it is not efficient or readily accessible online and cannot be shared. Synchronous training solutions such as video-conference fail as they still require both parties to be available at the same time.</p>",[],surespeak,3128638950,"[{""name"":""SureSpeak"",""permalink"":""surespeak""},{""name"":""iPractice"",""permalink"":""ipractice""},{""name"":""iRole"",""permalink"":""irole""},{""name"":""iProduce"",""permalink"":""iproduce""}]",[],"[{""is_past"":false,""title"":""Founder / CEO"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Darren"",""last_name"":""Schwartz"",""permalink"":""darren-schwartz""}},{""is_past"":false,""title"":""President"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Lou"",""last_name"":""Friedmann"",""permalink"":""lou-friedmann""}},{""is_past"":false,""title"":""Director of Technology"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Ilya"",""last_name"":""Beyrak"",""permalink"":""ilya-beyrak""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""Director of Customer Experience and Marketing"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Kristi"",""last_name"":""Klemm"",""permalink"":""kristi-klemm""}}]",[],video-flash-asp-net--net-coaching-sales-training-elearning-lms-role-play,$1.6M,SureSpeak,Thu Jan 21 19:17:07 UTC 2010,[]

If you consider the fact that the online game debuted in November 2004 and took only six months to go from 9 million to 10 million subscribers, you can conclude that it took Blizzard much longer to add this last million subscribers to its user base than in the past (the company announced it reached the 10 million mark in January 2008, up from 9 million in July, 2007).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, WoW was estimated to hold an impressive 62% of the massively multiplayer online game market back in April.\r\n\r\nOn 13 November, the second expansion of WoW, dubbed â€œWrath of the Lich Kingâ€, will launch in several regions around the world.

<p>Videos are assembled through a web interface that allows users to choose from a collection of motion backgrounds, stock footage collections, stock photography, surfaces and gradients, themed backgrounds, musical selections, text effects and sound effects.</p>

<p>Users can upload their own media, (video, still and audio) and store them online in their account. This media can be edited and incorporated into a new video mixing the stock footage and the users footage.</p>

<p>The simple interface allows users to view and preview the graphics and place them on a timeline.</p>

<p>The program has all the standard transitions and effects found in such non-linear editing systems such as Adobe Premiere, Premiere Cut Pro and Sony Vegas)</p>

<p>Videos are rendered in near-real time and delivered to the client storage area. Additionally, the videos may be downloaded and submitted to file sharing services such as YouTube.</p>

<p>UNLIMITED CAPACITY ARCHITECTURE</p>

<p>InstantWebVideos.Com is based upon the Amazon.Com Elastic Cloud Model allowing for unlimited disk storage and virtually unlimited compute power for rendering. </p>

<p>Using the Elastic Cloud System, Instant Web Videos can dynamically scale the web video creation and rendering as demands increase and decrease. </p>

<p>Like the Animoto.Com Web Site, (a similar type of service), the system can scale from 1 Server to thousands of servers in under 10 minutes.</p>

<p>The System Architecture is completely distributed and separated. The front end application the user experiences is completely isolated from the rendering back-end.</p>

<p>As a highly complex AJAX enabled application, the user spends virtually all of the time working disconnected from a server. Only when previews are required does the system go to a media server for the video, image or audio media.</p>

<p>Once a user is ready to request their video, a message containing details of their job is sent to the Amazon Message Queue System.</p>

<p>Each of the back end rendering systems polls the Request Queue when they are idle and looking for a job to render. All assets required to generate a video are on the a many Terrabyte SAN which is distributed across the globe in Japan, the United States and Europe. In essence, each rendering machine is a clone of one another and has the same assets available in their logical disk drives.</p>

<p>Once a job is completed, the video is stored on the Amazon S3 Network and an email is sent to the user who may play it directly or download it to their local pc. </p>

<p>The output format can be specified by the user (AVI, MOV, WMV, or FLV) and can be automatically submitted to various file sharing sites using web services in a similar fashion to the Tube Mogul web site.</p>",[],innovsoft-consulting-limited,514 707-8192,"[{""name"":""Instant Web Videos"",""permalink"":""instant-web-videos""}]",[],"[{""is_past"":false,""title"":""Managing DIrector"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Brian"",""last_name"":""McTeigue"",""permalink"":""brian-mcteigue""}}]","[{""available_sizes"":[[[150,96],""assets/images/resized/0002/9473/29473v2-max-150x150.jpg""],[[250,160],""assets/images/resized/0002/9473/29473v2-max-250x250.jpg""],[[450,288],""assets/images/resized/0002/9473/29473v2-max-450x450.jpg""]],""attribution"":null}]",instant-web-video-web-videos-online-video-editing-online-special-effects,$0,null,Sat Nov 29 14:27:59 UTC 2008,[]

To do so, Gemzies aims to â€œstartâ€ at the point a Wikipedia-page â€œendsâ€. </p>

<p>Gemzies-pages are focused on a single topic. On that topic, they provide a structured and community-rated list of suggested sites, videos, images, news and books. </p>

<p>Gemzies-pages are created and maintained by fellow experts, who want to show their expertise to the rest of the world. Gemzies provides a â€˜virtual stageâ€™ for these experts, providing for expert ranking lists, expert search, and expert â€˜trackingâ€™.</p>

<p>Gemzies thus adds Digg-type rating, and Delicious-type tagging, to serious content focused on any single topic.</p>

<p><strong>The problem</strong>
There is no shortage of content on the internet. For every subject you can check thousands of websites, all giving you more or less the same info.</p>

<p>At this moment there is no website easily allowing experts to collectively gather, review and tag all kinds of serious â€˜web favoritesâ€™ (sites, videos, images, books, news), on any possible subject, in a single, structured page. </p>

<p><strong>The solution: Gemzies-pages</strong>
Gemzies-pages are focused on a single topic. They contain a structured overview of suggested relevant websites, videos, photos, books and news on that topic, all in just one view. </p>

<p>Gemzies-pages are filled and maintained by fellow experts, die-hard fans, or anyone with a serious opinion, on anything from Al Gore to ZZ Top. Anyone can apply to start a new Gemzies page, providing a clear affinity with the subject, and providing the topic isnâ€™t commercial or explicit.</p>

<p>Gemzies-pages need the passion, a bit of commitment, and the expertise of individuals who want to show their knowledge on Internet content to the rest of the world. By its very nature, Gemzies-pages will thus contain topics that people have a passion for, like sports, music artists, professions, science, hobbies, global issues, etc.</p>

<p>Unlike other initiatives, Gemzies does not pay a vast editorial staff to build the ultimate human powered link directory. Instead, Gemzies offers â€˜15 minutes of fameâ€™, highlighting both the authors, and the most valuable contributors, to a Gemzies page. </p>

<p><strong>A virtual stage for experts</strong> 
Our contributors add and review entries, simply for the sake of helping others getting started. </p>

<p>Experts who contribute to Gemzies-pages, are ranked on a â€˜virtual stageâ€™. Their contributions can be tracked, thus reflecting their expertise to the rest of the world. What comes from that is up to the experts themselves&#8230;</p>

<p>Visitors can easily search for experts, and their individual contributions. Experts can be â€˜bookmarkedâ€™, informing visitors when new entries have been made by the expert, all depending on the privacy settings chosen by the experts.</p>

<p><strong>Creating Gemzies pages</strong>
Page creation is a simple process; it takes an average user 30 minutes to publish a first version of a Gemzies-page, containing at least 10 relevant entries (videos, sites, images and books on a single topic). Gemzies takes care of page structure, look &amp; feel, video display, etc. </p>

<p>The creator of a Gemzies page is recognized as â€˜authorâ€™ of the page. After publication, the Gemzies-page is â€˜openâ€™ to the rest of the world, to add new entries and review existing entries. Fellow experts who contribute to the page, are automatically added in the experts ranking list. </p>

<p>Gemzies provides tools to suggest relevant content for new entries, using APIs from Google (to suggest relevant websites and books), and Youtube (for videos).</p>

<p>Finally, a Gemzies page automatically displays the latest news on the specific topic (currently based on Google News).</p>

<p><strong>Content tagging and rating</strong>
Similar to e.g. Delicious, contributors can add tags to new entries for a Gemzies-page, or suggest additional tags to existing entries. These tags support other users to browse the Gemzies-page. The tags are also fed into a search engine (basic, for now), enabling visitors to search for relevant content across the entire Gemzies database.</p>

<p>Similar to e.g. Digg, visitors can â€˜voteâ€™ on the suggested entries from others. Based on these votes, the most popular sites, videos, images and books will appear â€˜on topâ€™ of their category. Unlike Digg (and many of its clones), we allow our visitors to â€˜voteâ€™ for anything but news, since we consider news to have a much shorter-lived life span, when compared to sites, videos, etc. </p>

<p><strong>Page quality</strong>
Gemzies fully understands it needs to grow towards a tipping point, in order to increase the relevancy of its content. </p>

<p>To quickly judge the &#8220;quality&#8221; of a Gemzies page, it will be ranked with an overall quality indicator, ranging from 1 to 5 Gemzies. These Gemzies are earned based on a.o. the number of active contributors, and the average rating of entries by visitors and fellow experts. </p>",[],gemzies,+31-6-27095251,[],[],"[{""is_past"":false,""title"":"""",""person"":{""first_name"":""Dirk"",""last_name"":""van der Heijden"",""permalink"":""dirk-van-der-heijden""}},{""is_past"":false,""title"":"""",""person"":{""first_name"":""Marcel"",""last_name"":""van Brienen"",""permalink"":""marcel-van-brienen""}},{""is_past"":false,""title"":"""",""person"":{""first_name"":""Vincent"",""last_name"":""Kouwenhoven"",""permalink"":""vincent-kouwenhoven""}}]","[{""available_sizes"":[[[150,125],""assets/images/resized/0003/1593/31593v2-max-150x150.png""],[[250,208],""assets/images/resized/0003/1593/31593v2-max-250x250.png""],[[450,376],""assets/images/resized/0003/1593/31593v2-max-450x450.png""]],""attribution"":null},{""available_sizes"":[[[85,150],""assets/images/resized/0003/1594/31594v2-max-150x150.png""],[[142,250],""assets/images/resized/0003/1594/31594v2-max-250x250.png""],[[255,450],""assets/images/resized/0003/1594/31594v2-max-450x450.png""]],""attribution"":null}]","social, community, expert, bookmark, wikipedia, topic, videos, images, news, books, ranking, serious, topics, favorites",$0,null,Sun Dec 14 00:12:05 UTC 2008,[]

<p>Gawkk organizes videos around channels, and members can subscribe to public channels that group videos in chronological order relative to a particular topic, such as a TV show, movie, celebrity, musical artist, comedian, etc. Members can save videos to their own personal video channel, follow other members&#8217; channels and share their saved videos with friends that follow them back, similar to the web service Twitter. Gawkk also includes other social community features, such as the ability to vote videos up or down, with videos that receive the most votes being promoted to the home page for the entire community to see, much like the news site digg.</p>

Sport Prediction Communities consist of very enthusiastic and loyal members who discuss upcoming sporting events; they then compete with their virtual peers to see who will better predict the results of these events.</p>

<p>Hunchers.com takes care of the whole prediction process: it publicizes upcoming events, records member predictions, announces the results when they become available and keeps track of the points members have accumulated. In addition, in order to garner the growing worldwide popularity of sports, the site was designed with multilingualism in
mind to ensure a large potential user base.</p>

<p>Hunchers.com presently covers soccer, basketball and American football, though is designed to support all kinds of sports with Tennis and Baseball next to be implemented.</p>

<p>Being an active member of a Sport Prediction Community fulfills an individual&#8217;s need for belonging, need for interaction, and based on the quality of their predictions, that individual&#8217;s need to be appreciated by his/her peers.</p>

<p>But can crowds better predict the results of sporting events than a handful of experts?
Well, a book published in 2004 with the intriguing title &#8220;The wisdom of the crowds&#8221; says that they can.

<p>The website was founded by Logan back in June of 2008, containing a blog where news is posted, and a forum consisting of thousands of users. Since then, the site has expanded exponentially, moving to other areas of entertainment, such as game events, live streaming, and online video.</p>

<p>RazeTheWorld features two groups of blogs. A main blog, where official writers maintain their standpoint on games or hardware, talk about current events, or post current news regarding the industry. RazeTheWorld also features a Community Blog, where any member of the community can voice their opinion in the form of a news article, blog, or rant. </p>

<p>RazeTheWorld utilizes youtube as a means of relaying additional news as and general wackiness to the masses on their <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/razethew0rld"" title=""channel"" rel=""nofollow"">channel</a>. Most of the videos consist of news, gameplay videos of upcoming or newly released games for PC, or other general nonsense.</p>

<p>Part of what makes RazeTheWorld special is their intent to drift as far away from other gaming websites, making it a unique community, where users can voice their opinions and debate on different things in areas other websites fear to tread. The writing style of the authors often make the blogs or videos informative, yet fun and entertaining.</p>

<p>RazeTheWorld also features several game servers for PC games, hosting weekly or bi-weekly &#8220;events&#8221; in which members of the community put their skills to the test with site moderators and other community members in games like Team Fortress 2, and Counter Strike: Source.</p>",[],razetheworld,,[],[],"[{""is_past"":false,""title"":""Founder"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Logan"",""last_name"":""Hale"",""permalink"":""logan-hale""}}]","[{""available_sizes"":[[[150,145],""assets/images/resized/0005/4113/54113v2-max-150x150.jpg""],[[250,241],""assets/images/resized/0005/4113/54113v2-max-250x250.jpg""],[[450,435],""assets/images/resized/0005/4113/54113v2-max-450x450.jpg""]],""attribution"":null},{""available_sizes"":[[[128,150],""assets/images/resized/0005/4128/54128v2-max-150x150.png""],[[213,250],""assets/images/resized/0005/4128/54128v2-max-250x250.png""],[[384,450],""assets/images/resized/0005/4128/54128v2-max-450x450.png""]],""attribution"":null}]","razetheworld, raze-the-world, gaming-website, pc-gaming, games, hardware, grapbhics-cards, cpu, gaming-community, gaming-forum, pc-forum, hardware-forum, raze, the, world, rtw",$0,raze_the_world,Sun Nov 14 00:59:52 UTC 2010,[]

Located in Mequite Texas, since their founding in 1991. </p>

<p>Ushering in a new era of interactive entertainment with genre-defining blockbusters like Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM and QUAKE, id has secured itself a place in gaming history as one of the fathers of the modern video game. </p>

<p>They were one of the first game shops to make the shareware distribution model work. </p>

<p>It all began on May 5, 1991, when id Software, fresh off the heels of its success with the Commander Keen series of titles, gave the PC gaming world a glimpse of the future with the shareware release of Wolfenstein 3D. A shot of pure adrenaline, Wolfenstein 3D thrust gamers into a frenetic first-person universe of relentless action that would forever change the face of gaming. </p>

<p>Widely recognized as the original first-person shooter, Wolfenstein 3D was later inducted into the Computer Gaming World &#8220;Hall of Fame&#8221; for shaping the overall direction of the video game industry. </p>

<p>Then, on December 10, 1994, id unleashed DOOM on the world. A technically stunning opus of heart-stopping action, unspeakable horror and pure gaming bliss, DOOM heralded a paradigm shift in video games. Hardcore PC games were going mainstream. </p>

<p>Selling millions of copies and chalking up tens of millions of downloads as shareware, DOOM remains one of the most popular PC games ever. And the title&#8217;s impact on the gaming world is still felt today. </p>

<p>With DOOM, id Software put the shareware distribution model on the map, with the game&#8217;s runaway success owing a debt to the growth of Internet distribution. The company has continued to support shareware and other non-traditional means of distribution, influencing the way companies market and sell video games. </p>

<p>DOOM also introduced multiplayer gaming to the masses, allowing players to compete in intense 4-player LAN or head-to-head modem competitions. </p>

<p>id Software didn&#8217;t stop there, the team of innovators also made DOOM&#8217;s source code available to their fan base, encouraging would-be game designers to modify the game and create their own levels, or &#8220;mods.&#8221; Fans were free to distribute their mods of the game, as long as the updates were offered free of charge to other enthusiasts. The mod community took off, giving the game seemingly eternal life on the Internet. In fact, id discovered many of their current employees and development partners based on mods that were created and distributed over the Internet. </p>

<p>DOOM and its sequels went on to enjoy tremendous sales on virtually every gaming platform available - from the Sega Genesis to the Game Boy Advance. </p>

<p>The next quantum leap in PC gaming came from id Software in 1996 with the release of QUAKE. Based on an all-new graphics engine, QUAKE was the first truly 3D video game, allowing players to interact with the virtual worlds created by id like never before. Gamers were free to look and move in any direction, giving the game designers at id the freedom and ability to create incredibly immersive environments in this epic, single-player game. </p>

<p>id Software continued the tradition of QUAKE, with QUAKE II in 1997. Supporting multiplay for up to 32 players simultaneously, QUAKE II was a watershed hit for the company, selling more than one million copies, despite it&#8217;s steep hardware requirements. By now, it had become clear that id&#8217;s games were reason enough to upgrade, or even buy, personal home computers. </p>

<p>In 1999, the easy-going guys from Mesquite further cemented their place in gaming lore with the ultimate deathmatch experience, QUAKE III Arena and the QUAKE III: Team Arena add-on pack. Designed to be the ultimate multiplayer experience, QUAKE III Arena has become the defacto standard for professional gamers and is the game of choice for tournaments around the world. A QUAKE III Arena tournament is the centerpiece of id&#8217;s annual QuakeCon tournament and LAN party, played every summer near the company&#8217;s headquarters in Mesquite. QuakeCon 2001 winners alone pulled in a combined $50,000 in cash and prizes. </p>

<p>In 2001, id Software teamed up with Gray Matter Interactive and Nerve Software to develop Return to Castle Wolfenstein, a re-imagining of the original classic, Wolfenstein 3D. Built around the Quake III Arena graphics engine, Return to Castle Wolfenstein introduced a new generation of gamers to the epic series that started it all. In its first two months of release, Return to Castle Wolfenstein shipped over one million units worldwide, and has been widely acclaimed as one of the best computer games of 2001. </p>

<p>The company also has enjoyed success licensing its revolutionary technology to other developers. To date, id&#8217;s game engines have powered blockbuster titles from other producers, including Call of Duty, Soldier of Fortune, Half-Life, Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, Star Trek: Elite Force, Heretic, Hexen and more. </p>

<p>In August of 2004, id Software released the next chapter in the DOOM legacy, Featuring a new, mind-blowing gaming engine from John Carmack, bringing a terrifying new storyline based on the original masterpiece. </p>",[],id-software,,"[{""name"":""Quake Live"",""permalink"":""quake-live""}]",[],"[{""is_past"":true,""title"":""Co-Founder"",""person"":{""first_name"":""John"",""last_name"":""Carmack"",""permalink"":""john-carmack""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""Developed Cutting-edge Pattern Recognition Products"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Michael"",""last_name"":""Dwyer"",""permalink"":""michael-dwyer""}}]",[],,$0,,Mon Nov 25 18:40:38 UTC 2013,[]

It aims to achieve this, primarily by leveraging the power of new media and extending the effort to offline events and actions. But above all, achieve the mission by being the seeker of truth &#8220;herself&#8221; on the journey her vision charts ahead - not just be an organization, but be the way of being - as referred here as &#8220;She&#8221;.</p>

<p>At present, Culture Unplugged efforts are focused on enabling networks of socially &amp; spiritually conscious content and its creators. With presence in India, USA, UK, Indonesia and New Zealand, we are dedicated to bring authentic/independent voices of diverse cultures to global audiences. We are committed to contemplate and contribute to our personal as well as collective spiritual need of the time. Our focus is on the inner+inter cultural expression. Our aim is to work toward unity &amp; harmony through all kinds of man-made divisions.</p>

<p>In brief, Culture Unplugged, by and for global community of conscious storytellers, culture explorers and world citizens to reflect on issues and life experiences in contemporary world - a new media studio focused on producing as well as promoting socially &amp; spiritually sensitive stories/films that does not merely express but pulsate to energize, enchant, enlighten, engage or embrace the humanity in us all.
Festivals :</p>

<p>We debuted in May 2008 with our first online film festival. Till date, we have launched 9 festivals. At present, our plan is to sponsor 4 themes for these festivals: 1. We Speak, Here. 2. Humanity Explored, 3. Green Uplugged, 4. Spirit Enlightened. They focus to observe our external world, social issues prevalent today, and meditate on the spiritual state of the human consciousness at present - influencing our culture and nature, within and without, at present and of future.</p>

<p>Content Production :</p>

<p>We are focusing on producing digital/HD content. Our productions aspire to be low Cost &amp; global without any preconceived limits on form or length of the content which presents creative spirituality at work. We also invite collaborations across borders on documentary productions on specific social issues. We believe in innovation through peaceful subversion of the proverbial precepts. We DO NOT wish to produce to fill the spaces in media channel, but fill spaces within us.</p>

<p>filMedia network :</p>

<p>We have also launched another online platform recently, that caters to upcoming as well as established film-makers, looking to reach out to wider audience for social mission and/or find new markets &amp; connect with global producers. With this platform, we wish to facilitate cross-pollination of ideas, spirit and knowledge among storytellers, content producers, professionals from social/scientific arena and global audiences.</p>

<p>Distribution :</p>

<p>Our studio wishes to distribute films/media which shares Culture Unplugged&#8217;s vision &amp; mission, from willing independent artists and filmmakers primarily from Asia, MiddleEast, Africa but certainly not limited to these regional borders only. As our efforts are non-commerical at present, for distribution, we work with our partner distributor who is global and shares our mission, vision and understands our intention to offer transparent, fair and just partnership to film-makers/producers.</p>

<p>It is our intent to promote the content inspired by true events/stories or those innate cultural expression by storyteller touched by local life experience (in all forms : short films, shows/pilots, features, documentaries and music videos). At present, we promote &amp; distribute the talent + content from the participants of the Culture Unplugged festivals to television &amp; alternative distribution channels across the globe. If you wish to distribute with us but haven&#8217;t participated in festival, please send us your screener copy. Our distribution model is designed to provide a fair and democratized platform that is transparent and open.
Partners :</p>

<p>International organizations such as Link TV, IRIN, NDTV, UNDP(India), MTV EXIT, USAID are our core partners. Other partners include TERI, WWF(India), MINUSTAH, UNICEF(Hait), Pop!Tech Institute, University of Michigan, The Aspen Institute, UNODC, UN.GIFT, AFO, Oxfam Hong Kong. </p>",[],culture-unplugged-studios,+912065002520,[],[],"[{""is_past"":false,""title"":""Founder"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Anaal"",""last_name"":""Udaybabu"",""permalink"":""anaal-udaybabu""}}]",[],"film, film-festival, documentaries, hulu, sundance, ipad-tv, mobile-tv",$0,worldfilms,Mon Sep 02 09:44:02 UTC 2013,[]

   These new type of devices are at the boundary of the virtual and real
worlds. They are a key element in creating new types of interactions between people and digital content, such as information, games or social networks.
Our team has developed a set of enabling technologies:</p>

<ul>
<li>Our main solution is the Arimaz comObject services gateway, a client-server architecture to connect any object with web services and online content. For example, this solution enables simple objects to receive messages such as emails or to fetch information such as news headlines from the Internet.
<ul>
<li>Arimaz has also developed the nanoAPI embedded core, a low cost electronic module to enable the creation of interactive and networked devices. This powerful solution is a basic block to create devices with autonomous mobility, multiple ways to communicate with the user (sounds, lights, motions) and supports a large variety of sensors.</li>
<li>Finally, we are developing an Artificial Personality Engine to breathe life into animated objects. This embedded software solution is able to manage behaviors of artificial (or virtual) agents, such as entertainment robots or toys.</li>

The company builds highly social games that leverage the Free-to-Play model. Z2Live was founded in July of 2009 by Damon Danieli - a 14 year Microsoft veteran - and David Bluhm - a long time veteran of mobile content and entertainment - along with the backing of Madrona Venture Group. Lou Fasulo joined the company in its earliest stages to build-out and lead the company&#8217;s studio and publishing capabilities. Today, the company maintains dedicated studios and technology resources in Seattle, WA for building both mass-market social games along with more traditional 3D multiplayer games that fully leverage the advanced capabilities of new mobile devices.</p>

<p>The company&#8217;s first product, Trade Nations, has built one of the largest game communities on mobile having logged over 500 million game sessions since its launch. This highly social simulation / city builder game has garnered widespread recognition and has remained as one of the top grossing games on Apple&#8217;s AppStore since launch.</p>

<p>The company&#8217;s second game, MetalStorm, has widely been recognized as best in its category and became one of the top ranked and top grossing games on iTunes within 3 days of launch.</p>

<p>Both games lead their respective categories in terms of critical acclaim, user ratings, popularity and monetization.</p>

<p>Z2lIve also benefits from an advanced community layer that facilitates in-game, player-to-player transactions and highly social game mechanics. The Z2Live community layer supports the most advanced set of community features including in-game email, text chat, voice chat, real-time multiplayer, player icons, achievements, badges and a full social graph that is integrated with Facebook and twitter.</p>",[],z2live,,[],[],"[{""is_past"":false,""title"":""CEO"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Lou"",""last_name"":""Fasulo"",""permalink"":""lou-fasulo""}},{""is_past"":false,""title"":""VP, Platform"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Tom"",""last_name"":""Hubina"",""permalink"":""tom-hubina""}},{""is_past"":false,""title"":""VP, Engineering"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Ryan"",""last_name"":""Murphy"",""permalink"":""ryan-murphy""}},{""is_past"":false,""title"":""VP, Operations & Business Intelligence"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Glen"",""last_name"":""Pryer"",""permalink"":""glen-pryer""}},{""is_past"":false,""title"":""Board Member"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Ed"",""last_name"":""Fries"",""permalink"":""ed-fries""}},{""is_past"":false,""title"":""Director, Human Resources & Recruitment"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Mark"",""last_name"":""Alkhazov"",""permalink"":""mark-alkhazov""}},{""is_past"":false,""title"":""Director, Product"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Andrea"",""last_name"":""Moro"",""permalink"":""andrea-moro""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""Co - Founder / CEO"",""person"":{""first_name"":""David"",""last_name"":""Bluhm"",""permalink"":""david-bluhm""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""COO"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Lou"",""last_name"":""Fasulo"",""permalink"":""lou-fasulo""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""CTO, cofounder"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Damon"",""last_name"":""Danieli"",""permalink"":""damon-danieli""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""Backend Spoon bender"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Blythe"",""last_name"":""Dunham"",""permalink"":""blythe-dunham-2""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""Senior Developer"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Slipp Douglas"",""last_name"":""Thompson"",""permalink"":""slipp-douglas""}},{""is_past"":true,""title"":""Director"",""person"":{""first_name"":""Paul"",""last_name"":""Goodrich"",""permalink"":""paul-goodrich""}}]",[],,$6.5M,Z2Live,Wed Nov 20 06:56:33 UTC 2013,[]

<p>On January 1st, 2009 preAmped.com was released as a public beta with a few simple goals:
    Make it easy (for users who just want to know whatâ€™s going on)
    Make it comprehensive (what you need to know in a single place)
    Make it deep (get users involved in the local scenes)</p>

<p>preAmped.com is a website that caters to the occasional concert fan by exposing simple searching features backed by a vast database of artists, venues, events, locations, and users.  Functionality takes off with a collection of pages revolving around a single event to capture the experience.  Users can check out the artists, post comments, see who is attending, get venue information, post pictures, purchase tickets, and listen to music.  By linking these items to a single event we can create a sense of a &#8216;local community&#8217; around concerts. Imagine capturing the concert from the viewpoint of the fans at a single show then tracking that around the country and throughout the years. </p>

<p>preAmped currently has over 350k artists, tracking 250k events from all over the net. A complex system has been designed to merge and clean web data to give the user a simple presentation.

<p>Myfitbrain is innovative brain training software offered at no charge to users due to its unique advertising model. Myfitbrain, started with the premise of allowing everyone to benefit from fun software that stimulated the mind. In order for that to be possible, Myfitbrain came up with a new advertising model which allows advertisers to dynamically load products into the game pieces, significantly increasing product recognition when compared to traditional advertising methods.</p>

<p>Myfitbrain includes multiple types of mental fitness games focusing on different parts of the brain to sharpen the overall brain and encourage the generation new brain cells. While some consumers exclusively enjoy games such as Sudoku or crossword puzzles which stimulates some areas of the brain, stimulating many cognitive areas of the brain is significantly more beneficial. The learning management system built into Myfitbrain will maintain a player&#8217;s performance and drive them through the different games while challenging different cognitive abilities.</p>

<p>The patent pending advertising model will incorporate a company&#8217;s brand name or products (icons) directly into the playing of the brain games. During the course of play, users will be directly interacting with the icons. While people play the games, they will repeatedly say the icon name to themselves. </p>

<p>Myfitbrain will continue to develop more mental fitness games to keep the novelty of the game playing high which helps to stimulate the brain. Myfitbrain will work closely with its advertising partners and their agencies to develop challenging games that incorporate products into the games and that are stimulating to the mind.</p>

<p>Under-the-hood and behind-the-scenes is AG Labs - the R&amp;D arm of AggreGame. AG Labs has turned out a number of innovations in the social, real-time, and analytics space, most notably AggreTweet and Campaign Advantage.</p>

<p>AG Labs&#8217; Campaign Advantage, launched in January 2012, is a product and service offering providing companies with better market intelligence with easy navigation. Instead of just getting access to Twitter data, Campaign Advantage provides more meaningful, processed data that shines a light on user engagement with a given brand.</p>

<p>You can preview Campaign Advantage at the following URL. Bear in mind, while we’ve chosen two gaming Goliaths of 2011 in this sample site, our process can be applied horizontally across many industries.</p>

<p>Launched late Summer of 2009 is AggreTweet, a Twitter app which captures all the gaming buzz / conversations as it happens on Twitter. All feeds are real-time streams based on the Twitter Streaming API, and all the hottest games are tracked. Simple graphs and trending charts are then generated based entirely off Twitter traffic, which offers an easy visualization of which games are leading others in terms of volume of tweets. Publishers &amp; gaming enthusiasts alike can use these metrics for business or fun.</p>

<p>Since its launch, AggreTweet has proven to be a valuable resource in both historical analytics, but more importantly - trend prediction. Christmas 2009, AggreTweet successfully predicted NPD sales figures based purely on social media chatter. In 2010, Aggregame (leveraging AggreTweet&#8217;s technologies) forecasted record-setting numbers of tweets around the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3 2010), predicting over 500,000 tweets during the week of E3. As it turns out, the Tweets rounded out just over 600,000. Read all about it at http://blog.aggregame.com.</p>

<p>This deep integration with Facebook allows music fans to stream any of Saavn’s 2 million plus tracks using their Facebook logins and to enjoy their favorite music from Facebook, for a seamless social listening experience.</p>

Third party casual, advanced casual and premium games are distributed in a device-independent format similar in concept to MP3 or PDF.  This format lets consumers access and share games from any of their connected Antix-powered &#8216;screens&#8217;, which include mobile phones, TVs, STBs, PMPs, and PCs. In much the same way as they do already with music, photos and videos, consumers can distribute trial games virally across networks and off-line to their friends and family while still protecting the rights and revenues of operators and publishers.
